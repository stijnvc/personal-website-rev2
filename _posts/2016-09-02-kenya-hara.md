>Emptiness – irrespective of who uses it and how – is the pursuit of ultimate freedom. When an object is empty, it is ready to receive any image or use. Take two knives. One is a Henckels knife from Germany. The other is a Japanese yanagiba sushi knife. The Henckels knife is ergonomically designed, so that when you hold the handle, your thumb naturally finds its place. It’s very easy to hold and use. Meanwhile, the handle of the yanagiba is a wooden rod, simple and plain. The handle doesn’t instruct you where to hold it, so you can hold it anywhere, and in any way you wish. This simple and plain handle receives all the incredible technique of the Japanese sushi chef. The Henckels knife is simple, but the yanagiba is empty. They are both wonderful, but there is a difference.
