  <div class="about-text">

    <p>In finding solutions I don’t limit myself to one discipline within design,
    I take a multidisciplinary approach. Solutions appropriate to situations.
    The main focus lies on the process and a way of thinking. Everything can be
    designed.</p>

    <p>The process starts by looking at the surrounding factors and environment.
    Understanding the bigger picture. With this research led approach, I
    strive towards simplicity and clarity in my designs.</p>

    <p>In 2014 I started studying Industrial Product Design at HAN University of
    Applied Sciences. In 2019 I completed <a href="http://codesignstudio.strikingly.com/">Co-Design Studio</a>, a
    full-time minor in human centered design, working for real clients with
    coaching by experienced design professionals.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>"I like to think of Stijn as a philosopher with a knack for design.
      Besides being a good listener, a thinker, someone who likes to
      understand complex challenges on an abstract level, he is able to turn
      his thoughts into solutions and new directions. Stijn is extremely
      focused on finding the truth and seeing things for what they really are,
      and pays close attention to detail. If you want things done right, not
      just nice, Stijn is a valuable asset to your team."</p>
