Nota is a Windows Markdown* editor I created for myself to be able to write documents without being distracted by too many options. At the time (2014) there weren't any well designed Markdown editors available for Windows.

> \*Markdown is a text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers. Markdown allows you to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, then convert it to structurally valid XHTML (or HTML). ([Source](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/))

I built Nota using web technologies like [NW.js](https://nwjs.io/) because that allowed me to use my knowledge in web design and use that for building a "native" application. So the Nota editor is kind of a website disguised as a native application. You can view the source code for Nota [on GitHub](https://github.com/steinvc/Nota).
