The 2018 Revision of World Urbanisation Prospects states that In 2050, 68% of people on earth will live in urban areas. That means that 6,7 billion people will be living in urban areas compared to 4 billion today. More people living in the city will mean less space for everyone to live. What will this mean for how people use their space and the furniture in it?

People right now are living around their furniture, how can we change this and have living spaces adapt to the users needs? We like to call this Adaptive Living Spaces. We are looking for design opportunities by researching what the needs are of people who live in small spaces. What is important for them in their living space? And what are the challenges they are facing?

## Going In-Depth with the Target Group

Visiting people in their living space is not always an option. We looked into how we could talk with people about their space without being there. What we want to know: What does the space look like and what is in it? How is it used and why is it used that way?

To answer this we let the subject draw a rough floor plan of their space and the furniture that is in it. After drawing the floor plan we give the subject a colored marker to draw the first part of a normal day. Later we ask them to draw the second part with another color. The lines show us where they go and what they touch and use. This will give us a lot of material to ask questions into why they do the things they do, and how that makes them feel.

## Empowering People to Change Their Space

What we found is that how to best use their space is a journey for people. Along the way of using the space people discover what works and what doesn’t. But the awareness of what works and what doesn’t isn’t always there.

If we want to fulfill people’s specific needs we enter the territory of tailored solutions. If we empower people with a product that allows them to customize it to fit their needs, we are asking from them to think creatively, and to be aware of their needs regarding their space.

If we ask people to think creatively about their space and design it for their actual needs, we have to make them break through social and cultural barriers to be able to make honest decisions. How do I think I should be using my space? How do I actually use my space? How do I want to use my space? If we want to solve any tensions with a physical piece of furniture, people first have to be aware themselves of this tension, before they will be able to take action on it.

To answer this we suggest to take these three steps:

1. **Activate:** Stimulate people to take a look at their living environment and reflect on the way they use it.
2. **Reflect:** Help people reflect on their living environment in an honest and critical way to find out what they need out of their space.
3. **Facilitate:** Provide furniture that can facilitate the changes people want to make to their space.

## Furniture as a Service

People are the experts in how they want to use their space, we believe they can also be experts in how they furnish it. This service assist people in thinking creatively about their space by lowering the bar for making improvements and playing around with different ideas. The freedom this service model offers to people makes it possible for them to have their space easily adapt to their needs, even if these needs change over time.

## Reflect

To help people reflect on the way they use their space we developed a small Reflection Tool Book. In this book you will find different tools to help you find out what you really need in your home. Do you really know what your ideal home could be? To help you find out what this could be we will help you with different exercises you can try out in your own home. Once you get a feel of what you might need at this point in your space we encourage you to experiment with your space and furniture.

## Catalog

The catalog contains all of the available furniture. The furniture will be designed based on principles of modular and parametric design. What this means is that people who want a storage solution in their space put the dimensions (parameters) of the available space in the configurator. The configurator will then look in the catalog for modular parts and then put them together in a way that will fit in the given dimensions. This is then still customisable by the user.

Modular options could also include different upholstery, colours, material options and other add-ons.

## Configurator

The configurator is an application which allows the user to create a configuration of furniture based on their needs and available space. It draws from the catalog to create these configurations.

It also keeps track of the furniture that is already in your house. You could for example change the color of the upholstery of a chair. The configurator already knows that you have the framework of the chair, so the only part that has to be delivered to you is the upholstery.

## Furniture in Use
When the furniture is in use there are several different options available for people.

**Swap broken or damaged parts**<br>
When people receive a faulty part or it breaks by normal use, they should be able to have it picked up and replaced.

**Every 3 months**<br>
Every three months people will have the opportunity to change their configuration. You could also leave everything like it is.

Outside of that there is an option to buy your current configuration. Depending on how long you have the furniture in your home this could become cheaper. Buying the furniture could be out of financial concern or because people have the feeling they have found their ideal configuration. In none of these situations should the ending of the subscription mean that the furniture will disappear.

**Life events**<br>
If a needed change is urgent there should be options to change you configuration outside of the “every three months” moment.

## Sustainability

If we look at the future and the environmental concerns that come with it, service models like this create opportunity for more sustainable solutions.

By having people pay for a service and not the physical object, you create incentive with the provider of the service to make the physical objects as long lasting as possible. Providing high quality, long lasting objects will pay off in the long run. It means less repairs and returns caused by faulty hardware.

Less objects will end up in landfill beceause of modular and replacable parts that are owned by the provider of the service.

Having people use the objects that are still owned by the provider of the service, you are essentially doing large scale user testing. Returned furniture will give insight to designers and manufactures in how to improve their product.

## Next...

Reimagining furniture as a service drastically changes the role for the designers and users of the furniture. The subscription model is a feedback loop, which creates a partnership between the user and the provider of the service: working together on getting the best use out of a space. The question is, how do people see this influencing their lives? Do people gain enough from a service to do away with the trusted idea of ownership?
