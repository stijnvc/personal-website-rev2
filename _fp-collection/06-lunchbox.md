A lot of plastic lunchboxes look just like that: plastic boxes. Plastic lunchboxes do have the great advantage of being nearly unbreakable, light, dishwasher safe and microwave safe. But why not design it more like actual tableware? I set out to design a lunchbox that has the esthetic like it could be made out of ceramics.

## Concept

Besides just sandwiches, there is a lot more people like to bring as lunch. I strived to accommodate as many types of lunch foods as possible in the lunchbox design.
