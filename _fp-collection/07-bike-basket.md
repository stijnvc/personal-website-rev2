The plastic shopping bag is on its way out. Can we offer people that travel to

This Bike Basket functions as a shopping basket when you are doing your shopping.
When traveling home it can easily be mounted onto the back or front rack of your bike.
The mounting unit is attached to your bike using heavy duty tie-wraps.
